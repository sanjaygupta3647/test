What I need first:

* Online minute jobs site 'to-do list': 

1. change $3 to $5 on the red bonus (remember it's on the home page and sign up page)

2. hide the 'More Jobs' tab....this is not ready so members don't need to access it
add in it's place 'Getting Started' page. (Just add the page and make it visible inside the members area. I will add the content).

* Homebase Business Consultants site 'to-do' list:
complete the items we talked about for this site next

* Puzzle/groupon 'to-do' list:
complete this last [ IMPORTANT IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANT DONE MESSAGE ME].

* I need the first two sites (onlineminutejobs & homebase business consultants) done today.
